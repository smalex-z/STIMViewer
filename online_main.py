    # 1) Load the movie
    # -------------------------------

    # If using HDF5, supply dataset_name; for .avi/.mp4 leave it None.
    movie_path   = "synthetic_calcium_movie (1).mp4" # Path to movie, better if in root directory like it is here
    movie = load_movie(movie_path, "None")

    # -------------------------------
    # 2) Compute mean projection

    # chunk_size:   frames read per chunk (increase to lower RAM usage)

    # 3) Threshold & extract ROIs

        # Any component bigger than this will be split into more rois using watershed
    )

    # We can adjust it accordingly or devise an algorithim that does that
    
    print(f"Detected {len(masks)} ROIs") # print how many rois found

    # -------------------------------
    # 4) Save your ROI masks
    # -------------------------------
